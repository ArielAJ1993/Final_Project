Thank you for using Expeditious Weather!


After you run Expeditious Weather you can input your city, if an error occurs you can try again by either closing and rerunning the code or using the function ‘new_city()’.


The code guides you through the process. There is an available list of commands/functions list that you can pull up at any time with ‘commands()’


Enjoy!
